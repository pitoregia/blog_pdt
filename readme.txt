We sincerely apologize that the assignment we have given is not as requested by sir Williem. There have been miscommunication and disconnections between our members, making our work messy. We were instead sent unfinished and bland assignments. We are very sorry.

I fixed and updated the correct assignment this time. Please give the correct grades for the fixes we provide. Thank you, sir :D
